A small [NEXT.js](https://nextjs.org/) template with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

To use this code, execute `npx degit GiyoMoon/nextjs-template {folder_name}`.

I use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), but feel free to switch to yarn or npm. Just delete the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file and execute `yarn/npm install`.

The app name is `nextjs-app` (Used in `package.json`). You can search and replace this string with your own name :)
